## Introduction

Employee attrition, the loss of employees through voluntary or involuntary separation, can have a significant impact on an organization's productivity and overall success. This repository contains code and models that aim to predict employee attrition and identify factors that contribute to it. By leveraging data science and machine learning, we can gain valuable insights into employee retention strategies.

## Dataset

The project is built around the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which includes various features related to employees, such as age, job role, job satisfaction, and more. You can find the dataset [here]([link-to-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)).
